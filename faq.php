                    <p>After our 1st Call with you, we can make an offer within 24 hours. The offer will be based on local market conditions in your area. The price and terms we agree at this stage will be the price we pay for the duration of the contract even if the property is vacant. From the moment we can agree on the offer it will take around 5 working days to complete our site visit and rental report. At this point, all being well, we will agree a rental start date that works for us both and set up the standing order to you. </p>
